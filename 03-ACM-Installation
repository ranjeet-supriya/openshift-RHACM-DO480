# RHACM installation and configuration

Step-01:
  > login to openshift cluster
  > search the 'Advance Cluster Management' from operator hub
  > click and install the RHACM operator (Note: always go for 'Manual' installation process for RHACM)
  > Wait for RHACM operator state == installed
  
Step-02:
  > once installation is done
  > create 'Create MultiClusterHub' instance
  > wait and see the status, it should be on running state

  $ login to openshift cluster where RHACM is running 
  $ oc get po -n open-cluster-management
  $ oc get route -n open-cluster-management
  $ open the RHACM dashboard 
    > Under Infrastructure -> Cluster -> Managed cluster (see the local-cluster is on READY state)
